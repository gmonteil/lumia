# LUMIA

LUMIA is a python library primarily developed to perform atmospheric inversions. The code repository has the following structure:
- the folder 'lumia' contains the actual lumia python library
- the folder 'scripts' contains example codes to use lumia
- the folder 'transport' contains a transport model code (see description further down)
- the folder 'src' contains the source code for the conjugate gradient minimizer used in the default setup (it needs to be compiled before an inversion can be ran).
